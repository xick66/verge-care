## Inspiration

Inspired by our own experiences as students navigating the job market and understanding the challenges faced during college placements, we set out to develop a solution that simplifies the hiring process. We recognized the need for a tool that not only assists job seekers in crafting compelling resumes but also aids employers in efficiently finding the right candidates.
